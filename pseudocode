reads csv file as dictionary

reads csv files header to extract str sequences to look for
    make list of str sequences

reads dna material as string

for each str sequence in range of length of str sequences
    takes each str sequences compares seq length of dna
        if no match
            moves one nuclotide
        if match
            moves seq length of nuclotide
            create new list with some name
            push first seq to list
                if next is match
                    push seq to created list list
                if not
                    return to higher loop

function to return number of longest of seq
in format of dictionary

compare two dictionaries
    if there is match
        retrun name of match
    if no match
        pritns no match
